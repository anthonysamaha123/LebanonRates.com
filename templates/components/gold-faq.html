      <h4>Why are your prices different from other sites?</h4>
      <p>Our prices are "We Buy" rates from Lebanon dealers, which represent what dealers actually pay for gold. Other sites may show retail prices (what you pay to buy) or international spot prices, which are typically higher. "We Buy" prices are lower because dealers need a margin when reselling.</p>

      <h4>What does "We Buy" mean?</h4>
      <p>"We Buy" prices are what gold dealers in Lebanon pay when purchasing gold from customers. This is the buyback or scrap price. It's typically lower than retail prices (what you pay to buy gold) because dealers need to account for their costs and profit margin when reselling.</p>

      <h4>Why do jeweler quotes differ from your prices?</h4>
      <p>Jewelers quote retail prices (what you pay to buy), which include their markup, workmanship costs, and profit. Our "We Buy" prices are what dealers pay when buying gold, which is naturally lower. Additionally, individual jewelers may have different spreads and overhead costs, leading to price variations.</p>

      <h4>What is the difference between karats?</h4>
      <p>Karat indicates gold purity: 24K is pure gold (99.9%), 21K is 87.5% gold, 18K is 75% gold, and 14K is 58.3% gold. Lower karat gold contains alloys (other metals) for durability. Prices are proportional to purity - 21K costs about 87.5% of 24K price per gram.</p>
